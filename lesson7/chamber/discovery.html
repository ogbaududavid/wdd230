            <img src="images/lcc.jpg" alt="lekki conservation center">
            <p>The Centre was established in 1990 to serve as biodiversity conservation icon and 
                environment education centre. The facility was built by the Chevron Corporation 
                for the Nigerian Conservation Foundation (NCF), as a reserved sanctuary for the 
                rich flora and fauna of the Lekki Peninsula. The company has since provided annual 
                funding for the management of the Centre.<br>
                To start the conservation project, three potential areas were surveyed in 1987 
                by NCF technical team in partnership with the defunct Lagos State Ministry of 
                Agriculture and Cooperative. Thereafter, Lekki area was chosen to establish the 
                demonstration site for the conservation project. Locating the conservation project 
                on Lekki Peninsula informed the name of the project - Lekki Conservation Centre. 
                The Centre was established by the Nigerian Conservation Foundation to protect the 
                wildlife and mangrove forests of Nigeria's South-West coastline from the threat 
                of urban development.

            <img src="images/lekki-bridge.jpg" alt="lekki-ikoyi link bridge">
            <p>The Lekki-Ikoyi Link Bridge, is a 1.36 km (0.84 mile) cable-stayed bridge in Lagos 
                State. It links the Phase 1 area of Lekki, with Ikoyi district of Lagos. The bridge 
                was commissioned on 29 May 2013 by the Governor of Lagos State, Babatunde Raji Fashola.<br>
                The Lagos State government, on the other hand, has argued that the collection of 
                tolls is not only required to maintain the bridge but also to generate funds for 
                building other bridges to link parts of Lagos. The waterway above which the bridge 
                is built is owned and controlled by the Federal Government of Nigeria.
                Apart from vehicular traffic, the bridge also serves as a recreational facility. 
                Fitness inclined residents of Lekki phase 1 and Ikoyi use the wide curbs of the 
                bridge for jogging and running, usually in the early mornings and evenings. 
                Tourists and other visitors also find this bridge as one of the places to visit 
                and the bridge is the most photographed place in Lagos. The founder of Facebook, 
                Mark Zuckerberg went on a morning run on the Lekki-Ikoyi Link Bridge on his visit to Lagos.

            <h2>Lekki Toll Gate</h2>
            <img src="images/lekki-toll-gate.jpg">
            <p>On the night of 20 October 2020, at about 6:50 p.m., members of the Nigerian Army opened 
                fire on unarmed End SARS protesters at the Lekki toll gate in Lagos State, Nigeria.
                Amnesty International stated that at least 12 protesters were killed during the shooting.
                A day after the incident, on 21 October, the governor of Lagos State, Babajide Sanwo-olu, 
                initially denied reports of any loss of lives, but later admitted in an interview with a 
                CNN journalist that "only two persons were killed".<br>

                The Nigerian Army initially denied involvement in the shooting, but later stated 
                that it had deployed soldiers to the toll gate on the orders of the governor of Lagos State.
                A month after the shooting, following a CNN documentary on the shooting, the Nigerian Army 
                admitted to the Lagos Judiciary panel of inquiry into the shooting that it had deployed its 
                personnel to the toll gate with both live and blank bullets.</p>
